#Binary Bomb Lab:

This file is a write up for the Binary Bomb Lab and we are gonna start with..

##Phase 1:

You can actually find it here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxTSOpG6X5M>. So let us skip it for now and start with `phase_2`.

##Phase 2:

So, after phase 1 defused we set a break point at `phase_2` and disassemble it: 
```
                call    j_read_six_numbers
                mov     eax, 4
                imul    rax, 0
                cmp     [rbp+rax+120h+var_F8], 1
                jz      short loc_7FF76B4820FC
                call    j_explode_bomb
loc_7FF76B4820FC:                       ; CODE XREF: phase_2+65â†‘j
                mov     [rbp+120h+var_11C], 1
                jmp     short loc_7FF76B48210D


loc_7FF76B482105:                       ; CODE XREF: phase_2:loc_7FF76B482130â†“j
                mov     eax, [rbp+120h+var_11C]
                inc     eax
                mov     [rbp+120h+var_11C], eax

loc_7FF76B48210D:                       ; CODE XREF: phase_2+73â†‘j
                cmp     [rbp+120h+var_11C], 6
                jge     short loc_7FF76B482132
                movsxd  rax, [rbp+120h+var_11C]
                mov     ecx, [rbp+120h+var_11C]
                dec     ecx
                movsxd  rcx, ecx
                mov     ecx, [rbp+rcx*4+120h+var_F8]
                shl     ecx, 1
                cmp     [rbp+rax*4+120h+var_F8], ecx
                jz      short loc_7FF76B482130
                call    j_explode_bomb

loc_7FF76B482130:                       ; CODE XREF: phase_2+99â†‘j
                jmp     short loc_7FF76B482105
```
* `phase_2 disassembly`

We could obviously see it calls a function called `read_six_numbers`, and if we disassemble it we would found that it reads six integers as input with function `sscanf`.
```
            lea     rdx, aDDDDDD    ; "%d %d %d %d %d %d"
            mov     rcx, [rbp+0F0h+Buffer] ; Buffer
            call    j_sscanf
            mov     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], eax
            cmp     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], 6
            jge     short loc_7FF76B48306E
            call    j_explode_bomb
loc_14001306E:                          ; CODE XREF: read_six_numbers+A7â†‘j
            lea     rsp, [rbp+0E8h]
            .  pop     rdi
            pop     rbp
            retn
```
* `read_six_numbers disassembly`

we can see it loads some format into `rdx` "%d" which is the format for integer number then it calls `sscanf` function which returns with the number of inputs we entered and sotre it in `eax` then compare it to 6
```
lea     rdx, aDDDDDD    ; "%d %d %d %d %d %d"       ;integer format
mov     rcx, [rbp+0F0h+Buffer] ; Buffer
call    j_sscanf
mov     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], eax
cmp     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], 6
jge     short loc_7FF76B48306E
```
* `input 6 numbers`

And we could see that it compares the first number with one and if not equal explode the bomb, and if equal jump to some address. So, we start with the set 1 2 3 4 5 6 and walk through the assemblyâ€¦â€¦â€¦
```
cmp     [rbp+rax+120h+var_F8], 1
jz      short loc_7FF76B4820FC
call    j_explode_bomb
```
* `If first number is one or not`

we see a sequence for a counter and a loop for checkingâ€¦
We could see that the condition for the loop is the counter below 6. Inside the loop, it does a shift lift operation with 1 `multiply with 2` to the numbers in the required sequence and starts with 1 and then compare it with each number in our input respectively after every shift operation. In other hand, it means that we shift lift 1 five times, and the result form each shift operation is an input, so shl 1 `first number in the input` is 2 `the second` number, shl 2 is 4 `the third number` and so on.
```
loc_7FF76B4820FC:
                mov     [rbp+120h+var_11C], 1       ;counter
                jmp     short loc_7FF76B48210D
loc_7FF76B482105:
                mov     eax, [rbp+120h+var_11C]

                mov     [rbp+120h+var_11C], eax
loc_7FF76B48210D:
                cmp     [rbp+120h+var_11C], 6
                jge     short loc_7FF76B482132      ;End phase_3
                movsxd  rax, [rbp+120h+var_11C]
                mov     ecx, [rbp+120h+var_11C]
                dec     ecx
                movsxd  rcx, ecx
                mov     ecx, [rbp+rcx*4+120h+var_F8]
                shl     ecx, 1
                cmp     [rbp+rax*4+120h+var_F8], ecx
                jz      short loc_7FF76B482130
                call    j_explode_bomb
loc_7FF76B482130:
                jmp     short loc_7FF76B482105 ;Back to the counter block
```
* `shifting loop`

So, from here we could obviously figure out that the sequence required is `1 2 4 8 16 32`.

And yeah, it worksðŸ˜Š

```
* `phase_3 disassembly`

We could see it took two input as integers as the format passed `lea rdx, aDD ; "%d %d"` before calling the `sscanf` function and checking if the number returns is `equal to 2 or not`.
```
mov     [rbp+150h+var_10C], 0
mov     [rbp+150h+var_EC], 0
lea     r9, [rbp+150h+var_12C]      ;second input
lea     r8, [rbp+150h+var_14C]      ;firstinput
lea     rdx, aDD        ; "%d %d"
mov     rcx, [rbp+150h+Buffer] ; Buffer
call    j_sscanf
mov     [rbp+150h+var_EC], eax
cmp     [rbp+150h+var_EC], 2
jge     short loc_7FF76B48220E
```
* `Input two integers`

And the first number should be less than 7 `(0:7)`. And we have a switch block depends on the first number we enter. So, if the first number in our input is less or equal to seven it moves an address depends on that number to the `RAX`. And depends on that address it jumps to a specific case inside the switch block doing some math`(add/sub)` operations till the end of switch block.
```
loc_7FF76B48220E:                       ; CODE XREF: phase_3+77â†‘j
                mov     eax, [rbp+150h+var_14C]         ;first input

                ja      short def_7FF76B482238 ; jumptable 00007FF76B482238 default case
                movsxd  rax, [rbp+150h+var_1C]      ;rax = 0;

                jmp     rax             ; switch jump
```
* `which address to jump to`

If we start from 0 (first case in switch) it `adds 274h` (628) then `sub 24Ch` (588) then `add 2B0h` (640) then `sub 7Eh` (126) then `add` it again then `sub` it and `add` it and `sub` it at the end of the switch case. After exiting the switch block it comperes the result with the second number we entered. So, after the switch cases the result for each number as a start for the switch block goes like `(0 --> 602 / 1 --> -26 / 2 --> 562 / 3 --> -126 / 4 --> 0 / 5 -->-126 / 6 --> 0 / 7 --> -126)`.

* `Switch block`

But if we dig into the code, we could see it returns and compares the first input `if it's greater than 5` and if greater explode the bomb.
```
loc_7FF76B48228F:
                cmp     [rbp+150h+var_14C], 5
                jg      short loc_7FF76B48229D
                mov     eax, [rbp+150h+var_12C]
                cmp     [rbp+150h+var_10C], eax
                jz      short loc_7FF76B4822A2      ;End phase_3
loc_7FF76B48229D:
                call    j_explode_bomb
```
* `If greater than 5`

So, the answer for this phase after exclude both 6 aand 7 should be one of these two-number sets (`0 602`  `1 -26`  `2 232`  `3 -126`  `4 0`  `5 -126`)

And like you thought it works againðŸ˜Š

* `phase_3 defused`


Yes, we are halfway of defusing the bomb congrats for us ^^_^^.


##Phase 4:
 
 From here things get more dirty and difficult. So, moving the breakpoint and disassemble `phase_4`

* `Phase_4 disassembly`

So, from here we could see it took two input as integers as the format passed `lea     rdx, aDD        ; "%d %d"` before calling the `sscanf` function and checking if the number returns is equal to 2 or not.
```
call    j_sscanf
mov     [rbp+170h+var_EC], eax
cmp     [rbp+170h+var_EC], 2
``` 
* `Inputs is 2`

After that it checks if the first number in input(saved in store `rbp+170h+var_16C`) is greater than `0`and below `14` which tells us our first input should be a number between these two numbers, now we have a little combination to try fromðŸ˜‚.
```
cmp     [rbp+170h+var_16C], 0
jl      short loc_7FF7B3B823CD
cmp     [rbp+170h+var_16C], 0Eh
jle     short loc_7FF7B3B823D2
```
* `Is it in range?`

After making sure that the first input is in the range ` 0-14`, it starts passing some values to the registers used in another called function `func4`, and moving 10 to a `rbp+170h+var_10C` a store is being used later in a comparison with return value from `func4` and again with the second input we entered stored in `rbp+170h+var_14C` and that gives us a hint that the return value from that `func4` must be 10 and the seocnd input for `phase_4` is also 10. 
```

* `func4 disassembly`

Inside `func4` we see a pattern of recursion for the function and as we saw before it must return with `10` and it actually accepts numbers between `0 14` many choices to try, better than trying to figure out what this function actually does, I tried brute force this function to see which number is actually returns with `10` and it was `3`.
So, let us assume that the answer for this phase is `3 10`.

And yeah, it works again ^^_^^:

                call    j_explode_bomb
```
* `Phase_5 disassemble`

And we can notice what kinda of input it expects. Yes, like the previous two phases it took two integers
```
lea     r9, [rbp+190h+var_10C]      ;second input
lea     r8, [rbp+190h+var_12C]      ;first input

cmp     [rbp+190h+var_EC], 2
jge     short loc_7FF61E1324D9
call    j_explode_bomb
```
* `Inputs is 2`

Then the action begins...
At first it does a `logical and (.)` for the firsrt input sotred in `rbp+190h+var_12C` with `F` which represnts all ones in four bits `1111` so it likes doing `and` with for ones, and like we know the result of anding with one is the same input `x . 1 = x`, the result from this section is actually the same input then moves `zero` to some stores to use them in a coming loop `rbp+190h+var_18C` as a counter and `rbp+190h+var_16C` as a store for add operation.
```
loc_7FF61E1324D9:
                mov     eax, [rbp+190h+var_12C]
                and     eax, 0Fh
                mov     [rbp+190h+var_12C], eax
                mov     eax, [rbp+190h+var_12C]
                mov     [rbp+190h+var_14C], eax
                mov     [rbp+190h+var_18C], 0
                mov     [rbp+190h+var_16C], 0
```
* `Anding and zeros`

The next block it turns out to be a loop block. It starts with comparing our first input with `15(Fh)` and if below continue excuting the loop.  
```
loc_7FF61E1324F6:
                cmp     [rbp+190h+var_12C], 0Fh

* `Loop Block`

```
cmp     [rbp+190h+var_12C], 0Fh
jz      short loc_7FF61E132524
```
* `If we reach 15`

After that some sort of counter to see how many iterations this loop takes.
And, it passes the value of the first input to `RAX` and load the address `7FF61E1324D9` to `RCX` and if we look at that address we'll see it has the value `10(Ah)`, then passes a value stored in address that appears to be an index of an array to `eax`.
```
mov     eax, [rbp+190h+var_18C]
inc     eax
mov     [rbp+190h+var_18C], eax
```
* `The counter`

```
movsxd  rax, [rbp+190h+var_12C]
lea     rcx, unk_7FF61E13F1D0
mov     eax, [rcx+rax*4]
mov     [rbp+190h+var_12C], eax
```
* `Index process and return to eax`

And, if we continue through the memory and do the math for this index address it appears for us we are dealing with an `array` with `16` elements `from 0 to 15` arranged in some order, and every element of this array works as a pointer in this operation `rcx+rax*4` to another element inside the array. Our goal now is to reach `15` to get out of the loop after `15` iterations. After a quick analysis and reverse the process, I found the start number shall be `5` to reach `15` at the end the goal here and our exiting condition from the loop after `15` iterations. 

![phase_5_memory](/Bomb%20Lab/phase_5_pattern.png)
* `Elemnts in the array`
`Using the start address stored in RCX (7FF61E13F1D0) and the index operation rcx+rax*4 you can follow the numbers in the previous image.`

But keep in your mind that after every return process it adds the return value from our array to `rbp+190h+var_16C` without the first number we start with which is gonna be the sum of the numbers from `0` to `15` excepts `5` and it's `115` and returns to comapre this result with our second input. At the end, this section must return with three values: `15` in `rbp+190h+var_12C` and also in the counter `rbp+190h+var_18C` and the sum of this array `excepts 5` in `rbp+190h+var_16C`
```

* `pase_6 disassembly`

Like `phase_2` this phase is actually dealing with six numbers. We could obviously see it calls a function called `read_six_numbers`, and if we disassemble it we would found that it reads six integers as input with function `sscanf`.
```
            lea     rdx, aDDDDDD    ; "%d %d %d %d %d %d"
            mov     rcx, [rbp+0F0h+Buffer] ; Buffer
            call    j_sscanf
            mov     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], eax
            cmp     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], 6
            jge     short loc_7FF76B48306E
            call    j_explode_bomb
```
* `read_six_numbers disassembly`

we can see it loads some format into `rdx` "%d" which is the format for integer number then it calls `sscanf` function which returns with the number of inputs we entered and sotre it in `eax` then compare it to 6
```
lea     rdx, aDDDDDD    ; "%d %d %d %d %d %d"       ;integer format
mov     rcx, [rbp+0F0h+Buffer] ; Buffer
call    j_sscanf
mov     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], eax
cmp     [rbp+0F0h+var_EC], 6
jge     short loc_7FF76B48306E
```
* `input 6 numbers`

After taking six inputs and sotre it into some kind of storage it checks at first if the numbers we entered is `between 1 and 6` and if one is not explode the bomb. While doing this check it also makes sure that the six inputs are different and there is no repeat. That gives us a clue that our input is the set of number from 1 to 6 but in what order?

```

* `No repeat here`

The next section in the phase it seems doing re-arrange the input in some order. But, when we look at the memory and look at the changes of the registers we notice we're dealing with `Linked List` has `six nodes` and every input of ours refers to a node in this linked list. So this section arrange the nodes of the linked list based on the order we entered our inputs. If we entered `1 2 3 4 5 6 ` the nodes must be order like `node1 node2 node3 node4 node5 node6`. And ofcourse these nodes has data in it which is gonna be our hero in the next section of the phase.

After re-arrange the linked list to catch up our input list, it starts again doing check for the nodes but this time for the data stored in it...
The right order for our input, so be the right order for the linked list nodes must achieve a condition which is the data stored in each node must be greater than the next to it.

* `Check if they arranged`

So, we must know the data stored inside each node and arrange them....
![Phase_6 memory](/Bomb%20Lab/phase_6_nodes.png)
* `Phase 6 memory`

After looking in the memory we could figure out the right arrange that achieve our condition is `5 4 3 1 6 2`

Finally we defused the Bomb, YeahhhhðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
![Phase 6 Defused](/Bomb%20Lab/Phase_6%20defused.png)
* `phase_6 defused`


###Secret Phase:

This phase has two condition to be activated one is really obvious if we disassemble the function `phase_defused` and it's that we must finish all the six phases which we did. The other condition is in the input we enter, but it doesn't ask for input after `phase_6` defused which means it's inputs are from previous phase and if we look at the inputs it takes to be activated, they are two integers and a string...
So, we must enter a string into a phase that took two integers as input and we have 3 options `phase_3`, `phase_4`, `phase_5`

* `three inputs: two integers and a string`

To figure out which phase is the one we're looking for, we are gonna check the pramaters this function takes `RCX/RAX` and see what does it stores...
![RCX memory](/Bomb%20Lab/RCX.png)
* `RAX/RCX in the memory`

From the memory we could see `RCX` points to `3 10` which is the input for `phase_4`, but it has a missing input here which is the string the third one for activation.
If we continue through the code we see it loading some string to `RDX` and took the string assuming we entered as parameters for function `string_not_equal` and that string is `DrEvil`.
So go back and try again with the Bomb and enter `3 10 DrEvil` as inputs for `phase_4`

```
lea     rdx, aDrevil    ; "DrEvil"
lea     rcx, [rbp+1A0h+var_190]

                mov     eax, [rax]
                cmp     dword ptr [rbp+0D0h+arg_8], eax
                jge     short loc_7FF7EADD1EA8

                mov     rcx, [rax+10h]
                all    j_fun7
                lea     eax, [rax+rax+1]
```
* `func7 disassembly`

Inside `func7` we can see that it's a mix of `phase_4` and `phase_6` principles. It has the recursion principle and a linked list with `15 nodes`.
If we follow these nodes at the memory we can see the data it stores, and it turns out to be all integers, and it compares those data with our input for this phase, so the input for `secret_phase`shall be integer as well.
`(n1 --> 36) (n21 --> 8) (n22 --> 50) (n31 --> 6) (n32 --> 22) (n33 --> 45) (n34 --> 107) (n41 --> 1) (n42 --> 7) (n43 --> 20) (n44 --> 35) (n45 -->40) (n46 --> 47) (n47 --> 99) (n48 --> 1001)`

* `func7 recursion`

We have many choices to try, so...
As we did with `phase_4`, we're gonna do here with `func7`. yes, brute force it untill this function return with `5` in `EAX` the flag defused this phase.
```
loc_7FF7EADD28E4:
                mov     edx, [rbp+130h+var_10C]
                lea     rcx, n1
                call    j_fun7
                mov     [rbp+130h+var_EC], eax
                cmp     [rbp+130h+var_EC], 5
                jz      short loc_7FF7EADD2901
                call    j_explode_bomb
```

So the value that returns with `5` is `47`

And yes, at the end we manage to defuse the Binary Bomb LabðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
